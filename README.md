# Lossy-DCOPF-with-an-accurate-modelling-of-Li-Ion-batteries

We propose a DCOPF model with constraints that accurately model the operation of Li-Ion batteries. In addition, we design an algorithm to calculate the ohmic losses of the transmission network iteratively. This project is motivated by the course MAE 207, professor: Michael R. Davidson, Fall 2021, University of California San Diego.

All the information about how to execute the files can be found in the file Readme.txt.

The format of the input files are based on the ERCOT 120-bus 500kV system. For further details, go to the website: https://github.com/east-winds/power-systems-optimization. The mathematical formulation have been implemented in the Julia Programming Language (1.6.3) under Ubuntu Linux 20.04 as operating system. We use CPLEX (academic license).
